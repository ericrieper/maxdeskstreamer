Using a fast FPS causes both dropped frames and substantial latency.\r\n* You can keep settings by clicking `Store Settings` and recall them with `Reset`. To save them for next time the patch is run, click `Store Settings` and then save the patch.\r\n\r\n##Client Instructions\r\n* Set incoming IP address or leave as \"ALL\"\r\n* Set incoming Port Number\r\n* Set `servername` for Syphon server- It will show up as \"Max - [servername]' in your Syphon client.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
